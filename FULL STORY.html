					<h2>THE <span>UNICORN IN THE GARDEN</span></h2>
					<h5>By James Grover Thurber</h5>
			<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once upon a sunny morning a man who sat in a
			breakfast nook looked up from his scrambled eggs to see a
			white unicorn with a gold horn quietly cropping the roses
			in the garden. The man went up to the bedroom where his
			wife was still asleep and woke her. &quot;There's a
			unicorn in the garden,&quot; he said. &quot;Eating
			roses.&quot; She opened one unfriendly eye and looked at
			him. &quot;The unicorn is a mythical beast,&quot; she
			said, and turned her back on him. The man walked slowly
			downstairs and out into the garden. The unicorn was still
			there: he was now browsing among the tulips. &quot;Here,
			unicorn,&quot; said the man, and pulled up a lily and
			gave it to him. The unicorn ate it gravely. With a high
			heart, because there was a unicorn in his garden, the man
			went upstairs to rouse his wife again. &quot;The
			unicorn,&quot; he said, &quot;ate a lily.&quot; His wife
			sat up in bed and looked at him coldly. &quot;You are a
			booby,&quot; she said, &quot;and I am going to have you
			put in the booby-hatch.&quot; The man, who never liked
			the words &quot;booby&quot; and &quot;booby-hatch,&quot;
			and who liked them even less on a shining morning when
			there was a unicorn in the garden, thought for a moment.
			&quot;We'll see about that,&quot; he said. He walked over
			to the door. &quot;He has a golden horn in the middle of
			his forehead,&quot; he told her. Then he went back to the
			garden to watch the unicorn: but the unicorn had gone
			away. The man say down among the roses and went to sleep.
			<p> <br>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As soon as the husband had gone out of the house, the wife
			got up and dressed as fast as she could. She was very
			excited and there was a gloat in her eye. She telephoned
			the police, and she telephoned a psychiatrist. She told
			them to hurry to her house and bring a strait-jacket.
			When the police and the psychiatrist arrived they sat
			down in chairs and looked at her, with great interest.
			&quot;My husband,&quot; she said, &quot;saw a unicorn
			this morning.&quot; The police looked at the psychiatrist
			and the psychiatrist looked at the police. &quot;He told
			me it ate a lily,&quot; she said. The psychiatrist looked
			at the police, and the police looked at the psychiatrist.
			&quot;He told me it had a golden horn in the middle of
			its forehead,&quot; she said. At a solemn signal from the
			psychiatrist, the police leaped from their chairs and
			siezed the wife. They had a hard time subduing her, for
			she put up a terrific struggle, but they finally subdued
			her. Just as they got her into the strait-jacket, the
			husband came back into the house. &quot;Did you tell your wife you saw a unicorn?&quot;
			asked the police. &quot;Of course not,&quot; said the
			husband. &quot;The unicorn is a mythical beast.&quot;
			&quot;That's all I wanted to know,&quot; said the
			psychiatrist. &quot;Take her away. I'm sorry sir, but
			your wife is as crazy as a jay bird.&quot; So, they took
			her away, cursing and screaming, and shut her up in an
			institution. The husband lived happily ever after.</p>

			<p><b>Moral: Don't count your boobies until they are
			hatched.</b></p></p>
