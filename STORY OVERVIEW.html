				<h2>THE <span>UNICORN IN THE GARDEN</span></h2>
				<h5>By James Grover Thurber</h5>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp James Grover Thurber's story "The Unicorn in the Garden" revolves around a husband and his wife meddling with the so called "booby-ness" of themselves. It started off with the husband seeing a unicorn in their garden with a golden horn, he tried to awaken and inform his wife about the matter but she refused to believe, stating that unicorns are only mythical creatures. The second time the husband did so, he was called a "Booby" which was something he hated being called at. And the author pointed out what booby and bobby hatch meant to the husband. Then, the wife called the police and a psychiatrist. The author seems to be humorous at this point as he delivered a twist of event, instead of the husband being the one to be speculated, the wife shouldered the effects of "booby-ness" which she told her husband. The wife tried to tell both persons about what had happened, but they did not bother believing. And when the husband was asked whether it was true that he told his wife that he saw the unicorn, he refused to say yes. The moral of the story is even more hilarious as it is nonsensical in its literal form yet life-relatable when thought really clearly. &quot Don't count your boobies until they are hatched &quot
