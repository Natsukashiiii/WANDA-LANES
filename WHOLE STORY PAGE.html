        <td> Once upon a sunny morning a man who sat in a
        breakfast nook looked up from his scrambled eggs to see a
        white unicorn with a gold horn quietly cropping the roses
        in the garden. The man went up to the bedroom where his
        wife was still asleep and woke her. &quot;There's a
        unicorn in the garden,&quot; he said. &quot;Eating
        roses.&quot; She opened one unfriendly eye and looked at
        him. &quot;The unicorn is a mythical beast,&quot; she
        said, and turned her back on him. The man walked slowly
        downstairs and out into the garden. The unicorn was still
        there: he was now browsing among the tulips. &quot;Here,
        unicorn,&quot; said the man, and pulled up a lily and
        gave it to him. The unicorn ate it gravely. With a high
        heart, because there was a unicorn in his garden, the man
        went upstairs to rouse his wife again. &quot;The
        unicorn,&quot; he said, &quot;ate a lily.&quot; His wife
        sat up in bed and looked at him coldly. &quot;You are a
        booby,&quot; she said, &quot;and I am going to have you
        put in the booby-hatch.&quot; The man, who never liked
        the words &quot;booby&quot; and &quot;booby-hatch,&quot;
        and who liked them even less on a shining morning when
        there was a unicorn in the garden, thought for a moment.
        &quot;We'll see about that,&quot; he said. He walked over
        to the door. &quot;He has a golden horn in the middle of
        his forehead,&quot; he told her. Then he went back to the
        garden to watch the unicorn: but the unicorn had gone
        away. The man say down among the roses and went to sleep.<p>As
        soon as the husband had gone out of the house, the wife
        got up and dressed as fast as she could. She was very
        excited and there was a gloat in her eye. She telephoned
        the police, and she telephoned a psychiatrist. She told
        them to hurry to her house and bring a strait-jacket.
        When the police and the psychiatrist arrived they sat
        down in chairs and looked at her, with great interest.
        &quot;My husband,&quot; she said, &quot;saw a unicorn
        this morning.&quot; The police looked at the psychiatrist
        and the psychiatrist looked at the police. &quot;He told
        me it ate a lily,&quot; she said. The psychiatrist looked
        at the police, and the police looked at the psychiatrist.
        &quot;He told me it had a golden horn in the middle of
        its forehead,&quot; she said. At a solemn signal from the
        psychiatrist, the police leaped from their chairs and
        siezed the wife. They had a hard time subduing her, for
        she put up a terrific struggle, but they finally subdued
        her. Just as they got her into the strait-jacket, the
        husband came back into the house.</p>
        <p>&quot;Did you tell your wife you saw a unicorn?&quot;
        asked the police. &quot;Of course not,&quot; said the
        husband. &quot;The unicorn is a mythical beast.&quot;
        &quot;That's all I wanted to know,&quot; said the
        psychiatrist. &quot;Take her away. I'm sorry sir, but
        your wife is as crazy as a jay bird.&quot; So, they took
        her away, cursing and screaming, and shut her up in an
        institution. The husband lived happily ever after.</p>
        <p>Moral: Don't count your boobies until they are
        hatched.</p>
